The purpose of this add-on is to provide a configuration panel for adjusting NVDA's audio options that are usually unknown to the average user, and only available normally through direct editing of the configuration .ini file.

If you know of any audio options that are not included in this add-on but should be, please report them.

## Configuration:

In the Settings tree of NVDA Preferences, you will find a "Advanced Audio Options" category. In the settings dialog you can change the following items. Each item has an edit box, where you can enter a number in the indicated range. There is often an upper and lower value required for each item.
* item up, item down (range)
    + Example of what is changed.
